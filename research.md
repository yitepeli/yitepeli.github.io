## Overview
My research aims to mitigate selection bias and domain shift in real-world oncology datasets using diversity-guided semi-supervised and metric learning, with robust evaluation under distribution shift.

## Selected Directions
- **Bias-aware learning in health data:** Methods that diagnose and mitigate selection bias and hierarchy bias.
- **Semi-supervised metric learning:** Diversity-guided strategies to leverage unlabeled data for fairer models.
- **Multimodal integration:** Joint modeling of omics, imaging, and clinical data for translational impact.

## Representative Projects
- **DCAST** — Diverse Class-Aware Self-Training for fairer learning under selection bias.  
- **Metric-DST** — Diversity-guided semi-supervised metric learning to reduce selection bias.  
- **ELISL** — Early–Late Integrated Synthetic Lethality prediction combining sequence embeddings with context-specific omics.
