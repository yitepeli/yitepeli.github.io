      My research interests lie in developing machine-learning methods to understand complex biological systems, with a focus on identifying therapeutic targets in cancer. Methodologically, I work with graph-based models, representation learning (embeddings), and multi-omics integration, and I care deeply about robustness under distribution shift and selection bias; bias mitigation; and rigorous evaluation for translational impact.

      I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Delft University of Technology in the Delft Bioinformatics Lab, where I work under the supervision of Joana Gonçalves. My recent projects include bias-aware semi-supervised and metric-learning approaches for bias mitigation in various ML areas (e.g., DCAST, Metric-DST), as well as multi-omics modeling for tasks such as synthetic-lethality prediction (ELISL), patient stratification, and pathway-informed patient clustering (PAMOGK).

      I earned my PhD from TU Delft (Delft Bioinformatics Lab, supervisor: Joana Gonçalves). Before that, I received a BSc in Computer Science from Bilkent University and an MSc in Computer Science &amp; Engineering from Sabancı University (Turkey), where I worked on multi-omics approaches to cancer subtyping.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to translate heterogeneous biomedical data into clinically meaningful, reproducible insights—tools that help prioritize targets, stratify patients, and ultimately inform precision oncology.
