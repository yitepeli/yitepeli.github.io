    <p>
      I am a researcher focusing on computational methods to discover cancer treatment opportunities.
      My work blends machine learning with biomedicine, with emphasis on mitigating selection bias and domain shift in real-world datasets (e.g., DCAST, ELISL) and robust inference for oncology.

      I am based in the Netherlands and enjoy interdisciplinary collaboration and mentoring.
