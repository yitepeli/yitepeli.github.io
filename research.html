<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  My research aims to mitigate selection bias and domain shift in real-world oncology datasets using
  diversity-guided semi-supervised and metric learning, with robust evaluation under distribution shift.
</p>

<h2>Selected Directions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bias-aware learning in health data:</strong> Methods that diagnose and mitigate selection bias and hierarchy bias.</li>
  <li><strong>Semi-supervised metric learning:</strong> Diversity-guided strategies to leverage unlabeled data for fairer models.</li>
  <li><strong>Multimodal integration:</strong> Joint modeling of omics, imaging, and clinical data for translational impact.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Representative Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DCAST</strong> — Diverse Class-Aware Self-Training for fairer learning under selection bias.</li>
  <li><strong>Metric-DST</strong> — Diversity-guided semi-supervised metric learning to reduce selection bias.</li>
  <li><strong>ELISL</strong> — Early–Late Integrated Synthetic Lethality prediction combining sequence embeddings with context-specific omics.</li>
</ul>
